# metadynamics

Contains data used to generate the tables and figures in the manuscript: 
"GPU-Enhanced DFTB Metadynamics for Efficiently Predicting Free Energies of Biochemical Systems".

## adp_files:
contains the scripts and data used to generate fig.1, fig.2, and fig.3 in the manuscript. Also contains the 
geometry files for alanine dipeptide.

## remdesivir_files:
contains the scripts and data used to generate fig4, fig.5 and fig.6  in the manuscript. Also contains dftb and plumed input files used 
in performing metadynamics caculations.

## dockerfile: script used to create the gpu-dftb-plumed image using HPC container maker.
